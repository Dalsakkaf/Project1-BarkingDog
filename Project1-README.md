## Project Description:

```
In this project, our website will be an interactive calendar in which the user can plan out their entire week of eating. This calendar will allow the user to input three meals a week, and it will pull from a database that has information on each of the meal's necessary ingrediants. These ingrediants will then be tallied into a larger grocery list, and the user will be provided with a list that they can take to the store with them at the beginning of the week. This code will also pull from a nutrition database, which will give each individual item a nutrition score. This score will be tallied into a weekly mean score so that the user can see how nutritious their week of meals is. This score and grocery list will actively change depending on what the user has inputted into the calendar, and since this calendar is supposed to act as structure for the upcoming week, it does not matter what day of the week this calendar is being accessed on.
